## Project 1: Language Prediction Neural Network

## Image Recognition


This problem set revolves around image recognition tasks, specifically the detection of written text language. The objective is to explore convolutional networks and gain insights into the impact of network structure on model capabilities and training time.

## Data
The training data comprises excerpts of printed text in different languages:
- Danish
- English
- Russian
- Thai
- Chinese

The task at hand is to develop a neural network capable of distinguishing between these languages using grayscale images. The dataset includes separate sets for training and validation, which can be accessed through the provided Google Drive link.

## Tasks
1. Data preparation:
   - Download and organize the images on your local machine.
   - Consider utilizing powerful computing resources or cloud platforms.
   
2. Model implementation and evaluation:
   - Start by running the code on a small image sample to verify functionality.
   - Construct a neural network model tailored for handling image data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the validation dataset and compute accuracy.
   
3. Model validation:
   - Begin by separating English and Chinese (or English and Thai) languages.
   - Experiment with various hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, filters, kernel size, strides, and pool size.
   - Explore different epoch configurations to optimize model performance.
   - Analyze misclassified images to gain insights into model behavior.
   
4. Image preprocessing:
   - Develop code to crop and standardize image dimensions.
   - Explore cropping techniques to focus on relevant text portions for language distinction.
   
## Model Validation and Fine-tuning
Validating the model's performance involves applying essential machine learning skills, such as fine-tuning hyperparameters and adjusting the number of training epochs. By iteratively experimenting with these factors, you can optimize the model's ability to accurately classify images based on language.

## Project 2: KNN Cancer Classifier, Color Simplifier

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis prediction using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The dataset includes physical properties of cell nuclei obtained from biopsy samples.

### Features:
- The dataset contains 569 cases with 10 features representing mean, standard error, and worst values.
- The target variable is the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).

### Project Highlights:
- Exploring the dataset and analyzing feature ranges.
- Evaluating the accuracy of a naive majority-based prediction model.
- Comparing KNN performance with normalized and non-normalized features.
- Visualizing decision boundaries using different feature combinations.
- Assessing prediction accuracy through cross-validation.
- Applying feature normalization and Mahalanobis distance metric.
- Observing the impact of transformations on the decision boundary plot and accuracy.
- Performing image color reduction using K-means clustering.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of the KNN algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis prediction and explores various feature transformation techniques and metrics. It also includes an image color reduction task using K-means clustering. For more details, refer to the project documentation.
