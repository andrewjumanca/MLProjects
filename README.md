## Projects

### Project 1: Language Prediction Neural Network
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis prediction using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The dataset includes physical properties of cell nuclei obtained from biopsy samples.

## Features:
- The dataset contains 569 cases with 10 features representing mean, standard error, and worst values.
- The target variable is the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).

## Project Highlights:
- Exploring the dataset and analyzing feature ranges.
- Evaluating the accuracy of a naive majority-based prediction model.
- Comparing KNN performance with normalized and non-normalized features.
- Visualizing decision boundaries using different feature combinations.
- Assessing prediction accuracy through cross-validation.
- Applying feature normalization and Mahalanobis distance metric.
- Observing the impact of transformations on the decision boundary plot and accuracy.
- Performing image color reduction using K-means clustering.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of the KNN algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis prediction and explores various feature transformation techniques and metrics. It also includes an image color reduction task using K-means clustering. For more details, refer to the project documentation.

## Dataset Availability

Please note that due to the size of some datasets used in these projects, not all datasets are included in the project folders. However, where possible, links to the original source or public datasets are provided within each project's `.md` file. You can refer to those sources to obtain the necessary data for personal replication.
